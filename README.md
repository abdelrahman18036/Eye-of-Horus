# Eye-OF-Horus
Eye of Horus is a web app we designed to solve our challenge, "Orbital Sky." It's a simulation of the earth, the surrounding satellites, space debris, and displays all of their information and data when asked, like an interactive 3D map. This app can be used as a new field of education. The app is super simple to reach and use as it's an open-free source, and it satisfies the curiosity and passion for learning.
